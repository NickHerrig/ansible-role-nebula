# ansible-role-nebula

An Ansible Role that installs [Nebula](https://www.defined.net/nebula/)
on Linux.

[![CI](https://github.com/NickHerrig/ansible-role-nebula/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/NickHerrig/ansible-role-nebula/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Requirements

### A Lighthouse is Required
A nebula lighthouse is an host with a static public IP address.
Digital Ocean, Linode, and Oracle Cloud are all extreemly inexpensive options!
The purpose of this machines can be read about in the nebula
[docs](https://www.defined.net/nebula/introduction/#components-of-a-nebula-network).

### Nebula binaries Installed on Localhost
For simplicity, this role currently requires localhost to be the certificate authority.
Because this role creates and distributes certificates, nebula-cert must
be installed on the ansible machine. Along with this, you will need the nebula binary
to run nebula on your laptop, so it's best to install the latest
[release](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula/releases/tag/v1.3.0).

## Role Variables

### Installation Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
| -------- | --------| ----------- |

## Docs
Prior to using this role, I'd recommend giving the
[general nebula](https://www.defined.net/nebula/introduction/)
documentation a skim.

## Contributing
This role is heavily influenced from the setup steps documented
in the nebula [quick start](https://www.defined.net/nebula/quick-start/)
documentation. It tries to balance simplicity with custimization options.
Because of this it doesn't contain some of the highly custamizable nebula
options. If you'd like to see some implemented, open up an issue, fork, and create a PR!
